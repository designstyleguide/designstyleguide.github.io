When deciding on the amount of space to put between objects as well as their widths and heights, use multiples of eight. For example, the grid columns below are 48 pixels tall with 16 pixels of space between them.

The site was built on a reposive grid system, with 3% in between each column and 

<pre class=""><code>&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column three&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column three&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column three last&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
